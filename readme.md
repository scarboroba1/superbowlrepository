# Super Bowls hosted by US State.

## Intro
This project conducts the total amount of Super Bowls each US State has hosted. There have been fifty-nine Super Bowls hosted along 11 United States, some more than others. Florida has hosted the most Super Bowls, with the most of them being in Miami. Tampa and Jacksonville also have hosted some. 

## Data

Data was conducted by my own, after a few google searches I was able to compile this list with each value.

Florida 	17

## Symbolization and Design

I wanted to keep the map design simple and I chose the YlGnBu color dataset to clearly show the rise and gain between each state. I chose to put a blue tile card below with the title to have it kind of blend in with the ocean on the map to make it more appealing on the eyes.
